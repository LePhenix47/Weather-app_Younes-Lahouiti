# Weather-app_Younes-Lahouiti

So this repo contains the code of my 5th small project: a weather app

Took approximately 20 hours to make! I got a little bored and added some memes in the comments


I used the OpenWeatherApp API to get the temperatures info

The SVGs were taken from this website: https://www.amcharts.com/free-animated-svg-weather-icons/
